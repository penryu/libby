A set Rust and C programs demonstrating the various ways to call across the "C" binary interface.

## rust2c

The `rust2c` project demonstrates two different ways to consume a C library from a Rust binary.

Check out [the README](./rust2c/README.md).

## c2rust

The `c2rust` project demonstrates several ways to call into a Rust library from C.

This project goes a little deeper into the details of how libraries are linked.
